# Study Timer

Electron app which helps you to keep track of your study time.

Based on "Alura Timer" while studying the Electron course by [Alura](https://alura.com.br).

I've extended the idea by refactoring it using OOP, TypeScript, eslint and prettier.

In order to run it, first build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

and run:

```bash
npm start
```
